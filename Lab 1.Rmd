```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### 1) Compute the sum of the sequence 100 to 1000, going up by a constant value of 100 (100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000).
```{r}
sum(seq(100,1000,100))
  #seq(starting number, ending number,increase by what factor)
```

### 2) Compute the sum of these numbers (1,3,2,4,3,5,4,3,4,5,6,5,6,7,6,5,6,5,4,3,4,5)
```{r}
sum(1,3,2,4,3,5,4,3,4,5,6,5,6,7,6,5,6,5,4,3,4,5)
```

### 3) Write a custom sequence generator function using a for loop that generates a sequence from a starting integer value to an ending integer value in steps of 1. Demonstrate that it can produce the sequence 1 to 10.
```{r}
thesequence <- 1:10
for (i in thesequence) {
  print(i)
}
```
