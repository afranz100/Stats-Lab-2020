### 1) Compute the sum of the sequence 100 to 1000, going up by a constant value of 100 (100,200,300,400,500,600,700,800,900,1000).
```{r}
sum(seq(100,1000,100))
  #seq(starting number, ending number,increase by what factor)
```
### 2) Compute the sum of these numbers (1,3,2,4,3,5,4,3,4,5,6,5,6,7,6,5,6,5,4,3,4,5)
```{r}
sum(1,3,2,4,3,5,4,3,4,5,6,5,6,7,6,5,6,5,4,3,4,5)
```
